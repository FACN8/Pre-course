# The DOM schedule


1) start by [reading through this shortended MDN documentation](https://competent-benz-7e8471.netlify.com/) to get started on what is DOM. *approx 45 min*
> If you finished reading then tell the mentor so they can partner you up with someone for the next workshop.

2) after you got a fellow coder next to you go through [this workshop](./dom-manipulation-challenge), make sure to discuss the solution and have both sides understand it. *approx 1.5h then go over solutions with a mentor*

3) Build an [image carousel](https://github.com/FACN7/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/prerequisites/image-carousel.md#build-a-carousel)
4) Build a [Stopwatch](./stopwatch.md)
