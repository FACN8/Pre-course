## What's CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

## CSS example

Let's take a look at the following [example](https://codepen.io/shiryz/pen/VwwOBGa?editors=1100#0) in codepen.

As you can see you have an `h1` heading that appears in black, let's change it to red.

- In the CSS tab you can see the following code

```css
.heading {
}
```

- Add this line inside the curly braces: `color: red;`.

- You should see the color changing to red :tada:.
