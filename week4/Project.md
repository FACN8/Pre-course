# Build a JS Quiz

Your project for this week is to build a **one-page** JavaScript quiz. It might look similar to the one in the image below, but feel free to be creative.

## These user stories will help you build the app:

* As a player, I want to click on a button to start playing and see the first question.
* As a player, I want to see a multiple choice question with four possible answers.
* As a player, I want to choose an answer and to see it highlighted (colored, have its box checked, etc.).
* As a player, I want to click on a button to submit my answer and know whether it's the right one.
* As a player, if my answer was the wrong one, I want to see the correct answer.
* As a player, I want to know how many questions I have left (e.g., 'Question 2/5'.
* As a player, I want to receive one point for each correct answer and see my results when the games ends.
* As a player, I want to be able to press a button to restart the game

## Requirements
* One-page app
* Mobile-first design (this was one of the research topics last week)
* Mind accessibility, we'll be running your code through accessibility checkers
* Your site should be published using GitHub pages
* Your team needs to set up a new repository under your cohort's GitHub organisation and work together over the next two days to commit changes to this repository.
* The repository should include a README file. In this file please describe your site and its purpose (WHAT, WHY) and tell the readers about your workflow and journey to completion (HOW). It should also include a link to the live site. See [here](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme#readme) for a list of awesome README files.
* Use the things you've learned about CSS to make the game look really nice!

## Strech goals

* As a player, I want to see a countdown timer when I start playing. When my time is out, the game should end.
* As a player, I want to be able to skip a certain (limited) amount of questions per game. If I skip a question, my next answer will only be worth half a point.
* As a player, I want to see different question, depending on previous answers (e.g., if I know the right answer, the next question should be more difficult, but worth more points).
